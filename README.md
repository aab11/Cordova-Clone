Cordova-Clone
=============

This is clone of the Cordova/Phonegap API. It is a clone in the sense that it allows for simulation on a desktop browser. 

How to use?
============

The Cordova Clone replaces the Cordova API with another *simpler* API which allows it to simulate all functionality in the browser. Therefore, to get started you have to
* Copy the cordova-clone folder into your application (www) folder. 
* Link to the cordova-clone.js file in the cordova-clone folder. Make sure this is the last javascript file loaded before you own code. This is so the clone can replace the API objects. 
* Cowabunga!

If you would like to change the settings or data that you would get back from the api, such as geolocation, open the index.html file found in the cordova-clone folder and the necessary items.
